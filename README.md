## Original forum post

Just thought that some may be interested is some updated pics for Stracciatella.

This pack replaces all the guns currently in Vanilla JA2 and Stracciatella. 

There are multiple authors and credit goes where credit's due. 

I chose the best I could find of each gun and where there weren't many or any options I made a couple up. 

Known author's are Coolberg, Tbird49x, and me (Kaerar). I don't know if there are any others involved as a lot of standard 1.13 pics went in, but if there were then good work.
